                    <li>Beavers typically live in family units, consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring.</li>
                    <li>Young monkeys engage in playful behavior, which is essential for developing social skills and coordination.</li>
                    <li>Beavers build lodges with sticks and mud, which can be several feet tall and serve as a safe haven from predators.</li>
                    <li>Monkeys use a range of facial expressions to communicate emotions and social signals.</li>
                    <li>Beavers communicate through vocalizations, tail slaps, and scent markings to signal danger.</li>
                    <li>Monkeys are highly social animals and live in groups called troops, which can range from a few individuals to over 100.</li>
                    <li>Most monkeys are omnivorous, eating a diet that includes fruits, seeds, flowers, and small animals.</li>
                    <li>There are over 260 species of monkeys, divided into New World monkeys (found in the Americas) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia).</li>
                    <li>Beavers are herbivores, primarily eating tree bark, leaves, and aquatic plants.</li>
                    <li>Beavers can build dams that can be over a mile long, significantly altering their environment.</li>
                    <li>Each monkey species has its own set of vocalizations, which they use to communicate different messages.</li>
                    <li>Some monkey species, like capuchins, use tools to crack open nuts or gather food.</li>
                    <li>Monkeys are known for their intelligence and can learn complex tasks, including using symbols or understanding numbers.</li>
                    <li>Beavers have scent glands that they use to mark their territory with a musky scent.</li>
                    <li>Their fur is thick and water-repellent, allowing them to stay warm in cold water.</li>
                    <li>Many monkeys sleep in trees at night to avoid predators, while some species make nests for added protection.</li>
                    <li>Their teeth are constantly growing, which helps them keep them trimmed while gnawing on wood.</li>
                    <li>Beavers can hold their breath underwater for up to 15 minutes while swimming.</li>
                    <li>Monkeys engage in a variety of social grooming behaviors to strengthen social bonds within their troops.</li>
